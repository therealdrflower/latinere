# latinere
You parse a couple of built in words in Latin.

This app only supports 1st Declension Feminine, 2nd Declension Masculine and Neuter nouns. To enter the case you type 1-10 (Nominative is 1, Genetive is 2, etc.).

Fork this if you want to add more nouns/functionality.

I don't know if the words are correct since ChatGPT just generated them (I don't know them yet).

The words given may not be entirely correct

The name is a play on words of "Latine legere" meaning "to read in latin".
